- [CocoaPods/Cocoapods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods): The main CocoaPods repo.
- [CocoaPods/Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj): The repo for the Xcodeproj gem, which is used extensively.
- [EvanBacon/xcode](https://github.com/EvanBacon/xcode): Evan Bacon's rewrite of the Xcodeproj gem into TypeScript â€“ using this as a basis may save us a lot of rewriting.
